# üêù Apache Hive on Hadoop with Docker Compose

This project sets up an Apache Hive environment with a PostgreSQL Metastore, running on a Hadoop HDFS cluster using Docker Compose. It includes the following components:

- üóÉÔ∏è PostgreSQL as Hive Metastore backend
- üß† Hive Metastore service
- üêù HiveServer2 (for querying)
- üêò Hadoop NameNode & DataNode

---

## üì¶ Services Overview

| Service               | Description                            | Ports             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `hive-metastore-postgres` | PostgreSQL database for Hive metastore | `5432`            |
| `namenode`            | Hadoop NameNode (HDFS)                 | `9870`, `8020`    |
| `datanode`            | Hadoop DataNode                        | `9864`            |
| `hive-metastore`      | Hive Metastore service (Thrift)        | `9083`            |
| `hive-server`         | HiveServer2 (JDBC/Beeline interface)   | `10000`           |

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hive-hadoop-docker.git
cd hive-hadoop-docker
````

### 2. Start the Cluster

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> This will spin up the entire Hive + Hadoop stack in the background.

---

## ‚úÖ Verify the Setup

### üîç Access Hadoop Web UI

Visit: [http://localhost:9870](http://localhost:9870)
You should see the NameNode UI and verify that the DataNode is connected.

### üêù Check Hive Metastore

You can verify that Hive Metastore is running by ensuring port `9083` is open:

```bash
nc -zv localhost 9083
```

### üß™ Connect to HiveServer2

Use Beeline or any Hive JDBC client to connect:

```bash
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
```

Or inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it hive-server bash
beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
```

---

## üìÇ Data Volumes

| Volume Name     | Mount Path                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| `namenode-data` | `/hadoop/dfs/name`         |
| `datanode-data` | `/hadoop/dfs/data`         |
| `postgres-data` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` |

These volumes ensure persistent storage for HDFS and PostgreSQL data across container restarts.

---

## üßº Tear Down

To stop the cluster and remove all volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## üß∞ Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Beeline or a JDBC client (optional)
