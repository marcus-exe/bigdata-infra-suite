# Kafka + Zookeeper + Kafka UI Docker Setup

This repository provides a simple Docker Compose setup to run **Apache Kafka**, **Zookeeper**, and a **Kafka UI** locally on macOS.

---

## üì¶ Services

- **Zookeeper**: Required for Kafka broker coordination.
- **Kafka**: Apache Kafka broker with advertised listener for host machine.
- **Kafka UI**: Web-based interface to monitor Kafka topics, messages, and brokers.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- macOS (or a system where `host.docker.internal` resolves correctly)

### 2. Run the Stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
````

This will spin up:

* Kafka on `localhost:9092`
* Kafka UI on `localhost:8080`

---

## ‚úÖ Verifying the Setup

### Kafka Broker

Check if the Kafka broker is running:

```bash
docker-compose logs kafka
```

You should see lines like:

```
INFO [KafkaServer id=0] started (kafka.server.KafkaServer)
```

### Kafka UI

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to inspect topics, messages, and partitions.

---

## üß™ Testing Kafka (Optional)

You can test Kafka with a CLI tool like [kcat](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat):

```bash
# Example: create a topic
kcat -b localhost:9092 -t test-topic -P
```

Or add a Kafka client in your preferred language (Java, Python, etc.).

---

## üßº Cleanup

To stop and remove all services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## üìù Environment Configuration

Inside `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://host.docker.internal:9092
```

This setting ensures that clients running on your host can connect to Kafka inside Docker.
