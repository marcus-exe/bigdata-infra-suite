# üß† Data Lake Environment

This repository provides a pre-configured **Data Lake development environment** using Docker Compose. It includes components for object storage, distributed computing, SQL querying, and OLAP analysis.

## üê≥ Services

| Service        | Description                                      | URL/Port           |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **MinIO**      | S3-compatible object storage                     | `http://localhost:9000` (API)  
|                |                                                  | `http://localhost:9001` (Console)  
| **Spark Master** | Apache Spark master node                      | `http://localhost:8088`  
| **Spark Worker** | Apache Spark worker node                      | - (internal only)  
| **Trino**      | Distributed SQL query engine                     | `http://localhost:8080`  
| **Apache Kylin** | OLAP engine for big data analytics            | `http://localhost:7070`  

All services are connected via a shared Docker network named `datalake`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Run the Stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
````

To stop the stack:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## üîê Default Credentials

### MinIO

* **Username:** `minioadmin`
* **Password:** `minioadmin`

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Volumes

* `minio_data`: Persists MinIO buckets and objects
* `kylin_data`: Persists Apache Kylin workspace

---

## üß© Configuration

### Trino

Custom Trino configuration should be placed inside the local `./trino/etc` directory. This folder is mounted into the container at `/etc/trino`.

---

## üîó Network

All services are connected via a custom Docker bridge network called `datalake`, which allows them to communicate internally by service name.

---

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## üìå Notes

* Make sure ports like `8080`, `9000`, and `7077` are free before running the stack.
* Trino and Spark are designed to work together and can connect through internal service names (`spark-master:7077`).
