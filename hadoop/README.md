# üêò Hadoop Multi-Node Cluster with Docker Compose

This repository sets up a simple **Hadoop 3.2.1** cluster using **Docker Compose**, with one NameNode and two DataNodes.

---

## üì¶ Services

- **NameNode**
  - Web UI: [http://localhost:9870](http://localhost:9870)
  - Exposes HDFS on port `9000`
- **DataNode1**
- **DataNode2**

Each node uses the official [BDE2020 Hadoop Docker images](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop).

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml  # Main Hadoop cluster configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # You're here
````

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hadoop-docker-cluster.git
cd hadoop-docker-cluster
```

### 2. Start the Cluster

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> This will start:
>
> * `namenode` on port 9870 (web UI) and 9000 (HDFS)
> * `datanode1` and `datanode2`, connected on a shared Docker network

---

## ‚úÖ Verifying the Cluster

### üîç NameNode Web UI

Open your browser and visit:
**[http://localhost:9870](http://localhost:9870)**

Check **Cluster > Datanodes** to ensure both `datanode1` and `datanode2` are listed and marked as **Live**.

### üìÇ HDFS Report

You can check DataNode registration by entering the NameNode container:

```bash
docker exec -it namenode bash
hdfs dfsadmin -report
```

### üß™ Upload a File to HDFS

Inside the NameNode:

```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir /test
hdfs dfs -put /etc/hosts /test/hosts
hdfs dfs -ls /test
```

---

## üßº Clean Up

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Details

### Volumes

Data is persisted using Docker volumes:

* `hadoop_namenode`
* `hadoop_datanode1`
* `hadoop_datanode2`

### Network

A custom bridge network `hadoop-net` is used to enable hostname-based communication between containers.
